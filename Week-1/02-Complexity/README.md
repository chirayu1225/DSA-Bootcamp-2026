## Why This Topic Now

Before you write any algorithm, you need to know whether it will be fast enough. Two programs can both produce the correct answer, but one might take 20 steps where the other takes 1,000,000. Complexity analysis lets you predict this before running a single line of code - and every problem in this bootcamp will ask you to reason about it.

---

## Why Does Complexity Matter?

Imagine two programs that both find a number in a list of 1,000,000 elements. One checks every element one by one; the other uses a smarter search. The first takes 1,000,000 steps; the second, only about 20. Both are correct, but one is vastly superior at scale.

**Complexity analysis** lets us predict this *before* running the code.

## Asymptotic Notation

Describes how an algorithm's resource usage *grows* as input size `n` increases. We drop constants and lower-order terms - at scale, they don't matter.

> `5n² + 3n + 100` → **O(n²)**

| Notation | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| O (Big O) | Upper Bound | Worst-case scenario |
| Omega | Lower Bound | Best-case scenario |
| Theta | Tight Bound | Both bounds are the same function |

**Big O is the most commonly used in practice** - it tells us the maximum time an algorithm can take.

## Time Complexity - Types

### 1. Constant Time - O(1)

The algorithm takes the same number of steps regardless of input size. No loops, no recursion - just a fixed number of operations.

**Example - Array Index Access:**
```cpp
int getFirst(vector<int>& arr) {
    return arr[0];   // always 1 step, no matter how big arr is
}
```

**How we get O(1):**
There is exactly 1 operation here - reading a value at a fixed index. It does not matter if `arr` has 10 or 10 million elements; the step count never changes.

---

### 2. Logarithmic Time - O(log n)

The problem is **halved** at each step, so the algorithm barely slows down even for enormous inputs. Even for n = 1,000,000,000, log₂(n) ≈ 30 steps.

**Example - Binary Search:**
```cpp
int binarySearch(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target)      return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target)  left = mid + 1;   // discard left half
        else                         right = mid - 1;  // discard right half
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**How we get O(log n):**
Each iteration cuts the search range in half. Starting with n elements:
- After 1st iteration: n/2 elements remain
- After 2nd iteration: n/4 elements remain
- After k iterations: n/2ᵏ elements remain

The loop stops when n/2ᵏ = 1, i.e. k = log₂(n) → **O(log n)**.

---

### 3. Linear Time - O(n)

Steps grow proportionally with input size. Double the input → double the time.

**Example - Find Maximum (Linear Scan):**
```cpp
int findMax(vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxVal = arr[0];
    for (int num : arr) {       // visits every element exactly once
        if (num > maxVal)
            maxVal = num;
    }
    return maxVal;
}
```

**How we get O(n):**
The loop runs exactly once for every element in `arr`. n iterations × O(1) work each = **O(n)**.

---

### 4. Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)

Divide the input logarithmically, then do linear work at each level. This is the sweet spot for efficient, general-purpose sorting.

**Example - Merge Sort:**
```cpp
void merge(vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    vector<int> temp;
    int i = left, j = mid + 1;
    while (i <= mid && j <= right)
        temp.push_back(arr[i] <= arr[j] ? arr[i++] : arr[j++]);
    while (i <= mid)  temp.push_back(arr[i++]);
    while (j <= right) temp.push_back(arr[j++]);
    for (int k = left; k <= right; k++)
        arr[k] = temp[k - left];
}

void mergeSort(vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left >= right) return;
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    mergeSort(arr, left, mid);       // log n levels of division
    mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);
    merge(arr, left, mid, right);    // O(n) merge work at each level
}
```

**How we get O(n log n):**
- **Dividing:** We keep splitting in half → **log₂(n) levels** of recursion
- **Merging:** At each level, we touch every element once → **O(n) work per level**

Total = log n levels × O(n) work = **O(n log n)**.

```
Level 0:  [8, 3, 5, 1]          <- n=4 total work to merge
Level 1:  [8, 3]  [5, 1]        <- still n=4 total work
Level 2:  [8] [3] [5] [1]       <- base case, no work needed
```

---

### 5. Quadratic Time - O(n²)

Two nested loops, each running n times → n × n operations.

**Example - Bubble Sort:**
```cpp
void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {               // runs n times
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {  // runs ~n times for each i
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
        }
    }
}
```

**How we get O(n²):**
- Outer loop runs **n times**
- Inner loop runs **(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2** times total
- Dropping the constant → **O(n²)**

> n = 10,000 → ~50 million comparisons. Avoid for large inputs.

### 6. Exponential & Factorial - O(2ⁿ), O(n!)

Work **doubles** with every new element (O(2ⁿ)) or grows catastrophically fast (O(n!)). These appear in brute-force solutions. Dynamic Programming is often used to bring O(2ⁿ) problems down to O(n) or O(n²).

**Example - Naive Fibonacci (O(2ⁿ)):**
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);  // two recursive calls each time
}
```

**How we get O(2ⁿ):**
Each call spawns 2 more calls. At each level the number of nodes doubles:
```
             fib(4)
           /        \
       fib(3)       fib(2)
       /    \       /    \
    fib(2) fib(1) fib(1) fib(0)
    /    \
 fib(1) fib(0)
```
With n levels, total nodes ≈ **2ⁿ** → **O(2ⁿ)**.

> n = 50 → over a quadrillion operations with naive recursion.

### Complexity Growth Comparison

`O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)`

| n | O(1) | O(log n) | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(2ⁿ) |
|---|------|----------|------|------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 10 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 33 | 100 | 1,024 |
| 100 | 1 | 7 | 100 | 664 | 10,000 | too large |
| 1,000 | 1 | 10 | 1,000 | 9,966 | 1,000,000 | too large |

O(1) and O(log n) stay nearly flat. O(n) and O(n log n) rise steadily. O(n²) curves sharply. O(2ⁿ) is unusable for any meaningful input size.

## Space Complexity

Measures the **memory** an algorithm uses relative to input size.

> **Auxiliary Space** = extra memory used *excluding* the input. This is what interviews usually mean by "space complexity."

**Fixed Part** - does not grow with input (simple variables, constants)

**Variable Part** - grows with input (dynamic arrays, recursion call stack)

```cpp
// O(1) auxiliary space - only a couple of variables, no matter the input size
int sumArray(vector<int>& arr) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int num : arr)
        total += num;
    return total;
}

// O(n) auxiliary space - creates a new array proportional to input
vector<int> copyArray(vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<int> result(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    return result;
}

// O(n) auxiliary space - each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

> `factorial(4)` call stack at peak: `f(4) → f(3) → f(2) → f(1) → f(0)` - 5 frames → O(n) space.

## Key Tips

- `sort()` in C++ is **O(n log n)**, not O(1)
- Searching in a `vector` is **O(n)**; searching in an `unordered_set` is **O(1)**
- A loop where `i *= 2` or `i /= 2` runs in **O(log n)**, not O(n)
- Recursive functions use **O(depth)** stack space even with no extra arrays

## Before You Move On

- Can you look at a single loop and say its time complexity?
- Can you look at a nested loop and say O(n²)?
- Do you know why Merge Sort is O(n log n) and not O(n²)?
- Can you distinguish between time complexity and auxiliary space?
